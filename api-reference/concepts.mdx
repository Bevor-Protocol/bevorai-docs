# Core Concepts

Understanding the fundamental concepts of the BevorAI API will help you build effective security integrations and workflows.

## Authentication & API Keys

All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### API Key Management

- **Creation & Refresh**: API keys can be created and refreshed through the [BevorAI Dashboard](https://app.bevor.io)
- **Team Scoping**: API keys are scoped to specific teams, ensuring proper access control
- **Permission Scopes**: API keys have their own scopes, allowing you to create read-only keys for different environments
- **Security**: Never share API keys in public repositories or client-side code

### API Key Scopes

API keys support different permission levels to match your security requirements:

- **Full Access**: Complete read and write access to all team resources
- **Read-Only**: View-only access to projects, code versions, and audit results
- **Custom Scopes**: Granular permissions for specific operations or resources

<Note>
  Use read-only API keys in production environments or CI/CD pipelines where you only need to retrieve audit results and don't require write access to create new resources.

## Teams

Teams are the top-level organizational unit in BevorAI:

- **Access Control**: API keys are scoped to teams, controlling which resources you can access
- **Management**: Creating and updating teams is only accessible via the [BevorAI Dashboard](https://app.bevor.io)
- **Collaboration**: Teams enable multiple users to collaborate on security projects

<Note>
  Team management operations (create, update, delete) are not available through the API. Use the dashboard for team administration.
</Note>

## Projects

Projects are generic containers for logical separation of code and security work:

- **Organization**: Use projects to group related contract scans, code iterations, or security assessments
- **Flexibility**: Projects can represent different applications, protocols, or development phases
- **Tracking**: All audits and scans within a project are grouped together for easy management

### Project Use Cases

- **Contract Development**: Track all scans for a specific smart contract
- **Protocol Iterations**: Monitor security across different versions of your protocol
- **Feature Development**: Separate security assessments for different features or modules

## Code Versions

Code versions represent specific iterations or snapshots of your codebase:

- **Versioning**: Track different versions of your smart contracts or applications
- **Audit Tracking**: Each code version can have multiple audits associated with it
- **Iteration Management**: Compare security findings across different code versions

## Audits

Audits are security assessments performed on your code versions:

- **Non-Deterministic**: Audits may produce different results on subsequent runs
- **Multiple Audits**: It's recommended to create multiple audits per code version for comprehensive coverage
- **AI-Powered**: Leverages advanced AI models for thorough security analysis

### Audit Best Practices

- **Multiple Runs**: Create several audits for the same code version to catch different potential issues
- **Regular Scanning**: Schedule audits at key development milestones
- **Comparison**: Compare audit results across different code versions to track security improvements

## Workflow Example

Here's a typical workflow using these concepts:

1. **Team Setup**: Create a team in the dashboard for your organization
2. **API Key**: Generate an API key scoped to your team
3. **Project Creation**: Create a project for your smart contract development
4. **Code Version**: Create a code version for each major iteration
5. **Audits**: Run multiple audits on each code version for comprehensive security coverage

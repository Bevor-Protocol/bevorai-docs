# Using MCP for Secure Coding

Integrate BevorAI directly into your development environment to write more secure code from the start. Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration provides real-time security guidance, vulnerability prevention, and best practice enforcement as you develop.

## Development-First Security

### Real-Time Code Analysis

**As-You-Type Security**
- Instant vulnerability detection while coding
- Security-aware code completion and suggestions
- Real-time gas optimization recommendations
- Best practice enforcement and guidance

**Proactive Prevention**
- Catch vulnerabilities before they're committed
- Suggest secure coding patterns automatically
- Warn about dangerous function combinations
- Guide secure architecture decisions

### IDE-Specific Features

#### Cursor Integration

**Smart Code Completion**
```solidity
// BevorAI suggests secure patterns
function withdraw(uint amount) external {
    // ✅ BevorAI suggests: Add reentrancy guard
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    
    // ✅ BevorAI suggests: Update state before external call
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    
    // ✅ BevorAI suggests: Use low-level call with proper checks
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
```

**Security Linting**
- Real-time underlines for security issues

## Secure Development Workflows

### Pre-Commit Security

**Automated Pre-Commit Hooks**
```bash
# Install BevorAI pre-commit hook
npm install -g @bevor/pre-commit-hook

# Configure in .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: bevor-security-check
        name: BevorAI Security Analysis
        entry: bevor-pre-commit
        language: node
        files: \.(sol|vy)$
```

**Security Gate Integration**
- Prevent commits with critical vulnerabilities
- Require security review for high-risk changes
- Automatic security documentation updates
- Integration with existing code review processes

### Branch Protection

**Security-Based Branch Rules**
```json
{
  "branch_protection": {
    "required_status_checks": {
      "strict": true,
      "contexts": ["bevor/security-analysis"]
    },
    "required_pull_request_reviews": {
      "required_approving_review_count": 2,
      "require_code_owner_reviews": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Advanced Development Features

### Security-Aware Refactoring

**Safe Refactoring Assistance**
- Identify security implications of code changes
- Suggest secure alternatives for risky patterns
- Maintain security properties during refactoring
- Validate security assumptions after changes

**Pattern Recognition**
```solidity
// BevorAI recognizes and suggests improvements
contract UnsafePattern {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    
    function withdraw() external {
        uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
        // ⚠️ BevorAI: Potential reentrancy vulnerability
        msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        // 💡 BevorAI suggests: Move this line before external call
        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
}

// BevorAI suggests this secure pattern:
contract SecurePattern {
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    bool private locked;
    
    modifier nonReentrant() {
        require(!locked, "Reentrant call");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }
    
    function withdraw() external nonReentrant {
        uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "No balance");
        
        balances[msg.sender] = 0; // State update first
        
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}
```

# Glossary

Comprehensive definitions of key terms and concepts used throughout BevorAI documentation and the broader blockchain security ecosystem.

## BevorAI-Specific Terms

### BevorAI
The AI-powered security auditing platform that provides comprehensive security analysis, real-time monitoring, and automated threat detection for blockchain applications and smart contracts.

### Security Agent
Specialized AI agents within the BevorAI ecosystem that focus on specific security domains (e.g., reentrancy detection, economic analysis, governance security). Agents can work independently or in coordination with other agents.

### Multi-Agent Triaging (A2A)
Agent-to-Agent coordination system where multiple specialized security agents collaborate to analyze complex security scenarios, prioritize findings, and provide comprehensive risk assessments.

### MCP Integration
Model Context Protocol integration that enables BevorAI to work directly within development environments like Cursor and Windsurf, providing real-time security analysis as developers write code.

### Security Data Labeling
The process of expert security auditors reviewing and tagging BevorAI's findings to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the AI models. Contributors earn BEVOR tokens for high-quality labeling.

### BEVOR Token
The native utility token of the BevorAI ecosystem, used for governance, accessing premium features, rewarding contributors, and incentivizing security improvements across the network.

## Blockchain Security Terms

### Security Audit
A comprehensive review of smart contract code, protocol design, and system architecture to identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, and provide remediation recommendations.

### Auditor
A security professional who specializes in reviewing blockchain code and protocols to identify vulnerabilities and security risks. Auditors may work independently or as part of auditing firms.

### Smart Contract
Self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code. Smart contracts run on blockchain networks and automatically enforce agreements without intermediaries.

### Penetration Testing
Simulated cyber attacks against smart contracts or protocols to identify exploitable vulnerabilities and assess the security posture of the system.

## Vulnerability Types

### Reentrancy Attack
A vulnerability where an external contract calls back into the calling contract before the first function call is finished, potentially allowing attackers to drain funds or manipulate state.

```solidity
// Vulnerable to reentrancy
function withdraw() external {
    uint amount = balances[msg.sender];
    msg.sender.call{value: amount}(""); // External call
    balances[msg.sender] = 0; // State change after external call
}
```

### Access Control Vulnerability
Security issues related to improper permission management, where unauthorized users can access restricted functions or escalate privileges.

### Oracle Manipulation
Attacks that exploit price oracles or data feeds to manipulate protocol behavior, often through flash loans or coordinated market manipulation.

### Flash Loan Attack
Exploits that use uncollateralized loans (flash loans) to manipulate protocol state, extract value, or exploit economic vulnerabilities within a single transaction.

### Front-Running
The practice of observing pending transactions and submitting competing transactions with higher gas fees to execute first, potentially extracting MEV (Maximal Extractable Value).

### Governance Attack
Exploits targeting governance mechanisms, including vote buying, flash governance (using borrowed tokens to vote), and proposal manipulation.

## Technical Concepts

### Gas Optimization
The process of reducing the computational cost (gas) required to execute smart contract functions, improving efficiency and reducing user costs.

### Formal Verification
Mathematical techniques used to prove that smart contracts behave correctly according to their specifications, providing higher assurance than testing alone.

### Economic Security
Security measures that rely on economic incentives and disincentives to prevent attacks, such as staking mechanisms and slashing conditions.

### Slippage
The difference between expected and actual transaction prices, often exploited in DeFi protocols through sandwich attacks and price manipulation.

### MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)
The maximum value that can be extracted from block production beyond standard block rewards, often through transaction reordering, inclusion, or exclusion.

### TVL (Total Value Locked)
The total amount of cryptocurrency locked in a DeFi protocol, often used as a measure of protocol adoption and security importance.

## DeFi-Specific Terms

### Automated Market Maker (AMM)
A type of decentralized exchange that uses algorithmic trading to provide liquidity and determine asset prices based on mathematical formulas.

### Liquidity Pool
Collections of tokens locked in smart contracts that provide liquidity for decentralized trading and earn fees for liquidity providers.

### Yield Farming
The practice of lending or staking cryptocurrency to earn rewards, often involving complex strategies across multiple DeFi protocols.

### Impermanent Loss
The temporary loss of funds experienced by liquidity providers due to volatility in trading pairs compared to simply holding the assets.

### Liquidation
The process of forcefully selling collateral when a borrower's position falls below required collateral ratios, ensuring protocol solvency.

## Governance Terms

### DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
An organization governed by smart contracts and token holders rather than traditional management structures, using blockchain-based voting mechanisms.

### Governance Token
Cryptocurrency tokens that give holders voting rights in protocol governance decisions, such as parameter changes, upgrades, and treasury management.

### Proposal
A formal suggestion for changes to a protocol, submitted to the governance system for community voting and potential implementation.

### Quorum
The minimum number of votes required for a governance proposal to be valid and executable.

### Timelock
A security mechanism that delays the execution of approved governance proposals, providing time for the community to respond to malicious proposals.

## Network and Infrastructure

### Layer 2 (L2)
Blockchain scaling solutions built on top of main blockchain networks (Layer 1) to increase transaction throughput and reduce costs.

### Rollup
A type of Layer 2 scaling solution that processes transactions off-chain and submits compressed data to the main chain for security and finality.

### Bridge
Smart contracts that enable the transfer of assets and data between different blockchain networks, often targets for security attacks due to their complexity.

### Validator
Entities responsible for validating transactions and maintaining blockchain network security, often through proof-of-stake mechanisms.

### Consensus Mechanism
The protocol used by blockchain networks to agree on the validity of transactions and the state of the blockchain.

## Analysis and Monitoring

### Real-Time Analysis
Continuous security analysis that processes code changes, transactions, or system events as they occur, providing immediate feedback and alerts.

### Static Analysis
Code analysis performed without executing the program, examining code structure, patterns, and potential vulnerabilities through automated tools.

### Dynamic Analysis
Security analysis performed during program execution, observing actual behavior, state changes, and runtime characteristics.

### Threat Intelligence
Information about current and emerging security threats, attack patterns, and vulnerabilities relevant to blockchain and DeFi ecosystems.

### Incident Response
Systematic approach to handling security incidents, including detection, containment, analysis, recovery, and lessons learned.

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Score
Numerical assessment of security risk, typically ranging from 0-100, based on vulnerability severity, exploitability, and potential impact.

### False Positive
A security alert or finding that incorrectly identifies benign code as vulnerable, requiring human review to filter out incorrect results.

### False Negative
A failure to detect an actual vulnerability, representing a gap in security analysis that could leave systems exposed to attacks.

### Attack Vector
A specific method or pathway that an attacker could use to exploit a vulnerability and compromise a system.

### Threat Model
A structured approach to identifying and analyzing potential threats, including threat actors, attack methods, and system vulnerabilities.

## Integration Terms

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of protocols and tools for building software applications, allowing different systems to communicate and share data.

### Webhook
HTTP callbacks that allow applications to receive real-time notifications when specific events occur, enabling automated responses and integrations.

### SDK (Software Development Kit)
A collection of software development tools, libraries, documentation, and examples that enable developers to build applications for a specific platform.

### CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
Development practices that involve automatically building, testing, and deploying code changes to ensure rapid, reliable software delivery.

### Rate Limiting
Controls that limit the number of API requests a user can make within a specific time period to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource allocation.

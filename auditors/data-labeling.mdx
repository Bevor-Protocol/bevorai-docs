# Labeling Security Data

Help improve BevorAI's accuracy and effectiveness by contributing high-quality labeled security data. Your expert knowledge directly enhances the AI models that power security analysis for the entire ecosystem.

## Why Data Labeling Matters

BevorAI's effectiveness depends on high-quality training data. When security experts like you label findings, you're:

- **Improving Model Accuracy**: Teaching AI to recognize subtle security patterns
- **Reducing False Positives**: Helping models distinguish between real threats and benign code
- **Expanding Coverage**: Contributing to detection of new vulnerability types
- **Building Community Knowledge**: Sharing expertise to benefit all users

## How to Label Findings

### Through the Terminal Interface

1. **Access the Labeling Interface**
   - Open [app.bevor.io](https://app.bevor.io)
   - Navigate to the Terminal
   - Enable "Expert Mode" in settings

2. **Review and Label Findings**
   - Run security analysis on contracts
   - Review each finding in the results panel
   - Use the labeling interface to mark findings as:
     - ‚úÖ **True Positive**: Confirmed vulnerability
     - ‚ùå **False Positive**: Incorrect detection
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Uncertain**: Requires further review
     - üìù **Needs Context**: Additional information needed

3. **Add Detailed Annotations**
   - Provide specific vulnerability classifications
   - Add severity assessments (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Include remediation suggestions
   - Note any special context or edge cases

### Through API Integration

For automated or bulk labeling workflows:

```bash
POST /api/v1/findings/{findingId}/label
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "label": "true_positive",
  "severity": "high",
  "vulnerability_type": "reentrancy",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "notes": "Classic reentrancy pattern in withdraw function",
  "remediation_suggestion": "Add reentrancy guard"
}
```

## Types of Security Findings to Label

### Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
- **Reentrancy attacks**
- **Integer overflow/underflow**
- **Access control issues**
- **Front-running vulnerabilities**
- **Gas optimization opportunities**

### Protocol-Level Issues
- **Economic attack vectors**
- **Governance vulnerabilities**
- **Oracle manipulation risks**
- **Liquidity and slippage issues**
- **Cross-chain bridge security**

### Integration Risks
- **External dependency vulnerabilities**
- **Upgrade mechanism issues**
- **Multi-signature security**
- **Time-lock bypasses**

## Labeling Quality Guidelines

### Be Specific and Accurate
- Use precise vulnerability classifications
- Provide clear, actionable descriptions
- Include relevant code snippets or line numbers
- Reference established security standards (e.g., SWC registry)

### Consider Context
- Account for intended behavior vs. actual vulnerabilities
- Consider the broader protocol context
- Note any assumptions or prerequisites
- Identify edge cases and boundary conditions

### Maintain Consistency
- Use standardized terminology
- Follow established severity classifications
- Apply consistent labeling criteria
- Document any special cases or exceptions

## Recognition and Rewards

Contributors to BevorAI's security dataset receive:

- **Recognition**: Public acknowledgment in our contributor hall of fame
- **Token Rewards**: Earn BEVOR tokens for high-quality contributions
- **Early Access**: Priority access to new features and capabilities
- **Community Status**: Special roles in our Discord community

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Focus on quality over quantity. A few well-labeled, thoroughly analyzed findings are more valuable than many hastily labeled ones.
</Tip>

### Before Labeling
- Understand the contract's intended functionality
- Review the broader protocol context
- Check for existing similar vulnerabilities
- Verify your analysis with multiple approaches

### During Labeling
- Be thorough in your analysis
- Document your reasoning process
- Include relevant references and sources
- Consider multiple attack vectors

### After Labeling
- Review your labels for consistency
- Update labels if you discover new information
- Share insights with the community
- Track the impact of your contributions

## Scanning Methods

### Automatic Discovery

**Contract Detection**
```bash
# Scan all contracts deployed by an address
bevor scan-address 0x1234...abcd

# Scan specific contract
bevor scan-contract 0xabcd...1234 --network ethereum

# Scan entire protocol ecosystem
bevor scan-protocol uniswap --include-forks
```

**Smart Discovery Features**
- Automatic proxy detection and implementation analysis
- Factory contract pattern recognition
- Multi-signature wallet analysis
- Token contract comprehensive scanning

### Manual Analysis

**Targeted Scanning**
```bash
# Focus on specific vulnerability types
bevor scan-contract 0xabcd...1234 --focus reentrancy,oracle

# Deep analysis with full context
bevor scan-contract 0xabcd...1234 --deep --include-interactions

# Economic analysis
bevor scan-contract 0xabcd...1234 --economic-analysis
```

### Batch Processing

**Multi-Contract Analysis**
- Analyze entire protocol suites simultaneously
- Compare security postures across related contracts
- Identify systemic vulnerabilities
- Generate comprehensive security reports

## Alert Configuration

### Real-Time Alerts

**Critical Vulnerability Detection**
```json
{
  "alertConfig": {
    "critical": {
      "enabled": true,
      "channels": ["email", "slack", "webhook"],
      "immediate": true
    },
    "high": {
      "enabled": true,
      "channels": ["email", "slack"],
      "delay": "5m"
    },
    "medium": {
      "enabled": false,
      "channels": ["email"],
      "delay": "1h"
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Monitoring Strategy

1. **Immediate Post-Deployment** (0-48 hours)
   - Intensive real-time monitoring
   - Manual review of all transactions
   - Community sentiment tracking
   - Immediate response team on standby

2. **Early Operation** (48 hours - 2 weeks)
   - Automated monitoring with human oversight
   - Pattern establishment and baseline creation
   - User behavior analysis
   - Economic parameter validation

3. **Mature Operation** (2+ weeks)
   - Automated monitoring with exception-based alerts
   - Periodic comprehensive reviews
   - Long-term trend analysis
   - Continuous improvement based on learnings

### Alert Management

- **Tune Alert Sensitivity**: Balance between false positives and missed threats
- **Establish Response Procedures**: Define clear escalation and response protocols
- **Regular Review**: Periodically assess and update alert configurations
- **Team Training**: Ensure all team members understand alert meanings and responses

## Troubleshooting

### Common Monitoring Issues

#### Network Connectivity
- Verify RPC endpoint availability
- Check for rate limiting issues
- Configure backup node providers
- Monitor network synchronization status

#### Analysis Performance
- Optimize scanning frequency for high-traffic contracts
- Use targeted scanning for specific vulnerability types
- Configure appropriate timeout settings
- Balance thoroughness with performance requirements

# Using the BevorAI Terminal

The BevorAI Terminal provides a powerful, web-based interface for comprehensive security analysis. Perfect for detailed auditing sessions, collaborative reviews, and in-depth contract analysis.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Terminal

1. Visit [app.bevor.io](https://app.bevor.io)
2. Sign in to your BevorAI account
3. Navigate to the **Terminal** section
4. Choose your preferred analysis environment

### Interface Overview

The terminal interface consists of several key components:

- **Code Editor**: Multi-file editor with syntax highlighting
- **Analysis Panel**: Real-time security findings and recommendations
- **Command Interface**: Execute security analysis commands
- **Results Dashboard**: Comprehensive reporting and export options
- **Collaboration Tools**: Share findings and work with team members

## Core Features

### Multi-File Analysis

**Project Upload**
- Drag and drop entire project folders
- Git repository integration for direct imports
- Support for common project structures (Hardhat, Foundry, Truffle)
- Automatic dependency resolution and mapping

**File Management**
- Navigate complex project structures
- View multiple files simultaneously
- Track changes and analysis history
- Organize files by security relevance

### Comprehensive Security Scanning

**Vulnerability Detection**
```bash
# Basic security scan
bevor scan ./contracts

# Deep analysis with context
bevor scan ./contracts --deep --include-dependencies

# Specific vulnerability types
bevor scan ./contracts --focus reentrancy,access-control

# Export results
bevor scan ./contracts --output json > security-report.json
```

**Analysis Commands**
- `bevor scan` - Run comprehensive security analysis
- `bevor check` - Quick vulnerability check
- `bevor explain` - Get detailed explanations of findings
- `bevor fix` - Generate remediation suggestions
- `bevor compare` - Compare versions for security regressions

### Interactive Analysis

**Guided Auditing**
- Step-by-step audit workflows
- Interactive vulnerability exploration
- Contextual help and documentation
- Expert system guidance for complex issues

**Real-Time Collaboration**
- Share terminal sessions with team members
- Collaborative annotation and discussion
- Real-time finding validation
- Team consensus building tools

## Advanced Features

### Custom Analysis Profiles

Create specialized analysis configurations for different use cases:

#### DeFi Protocol Profile
```json
{
  "profile": "defi-protocol",
  "focus_areas": [
    "economic_attacks",
    "oracle_manipulation", 
    "liquidity_risks",
    "governance_vulnerabilities"
  ],
  "severity_weights": {
    "economic": 1.5,
    "governance": 1.2,
    "technical": 1.0
  }
}
```

#### NFT Project Profile
```json
{
  "profile": "nft-project",
  "focus_areas": [
    "access_control",
    "metadata_security",
    "royalty_enforcement",
    "marketplace_integration"
  ],
  "special_checks": [
    "erc721_compliance",
    "opensea_compatibility"
  ]
}
```

### Automated Reporting

**Report Generation**
- Executive summaries for stakeholders
- Technical reports for developers
- Audit trails for compliance
- Comparative analysis across versions

**Export Formats**
- PDF reports with charts and visualizations
- JSON data for programmatic processing
- CSV for spreadsheet analysis
- Markdown for documentation integration

### Integration Capabilities

**Webhook Integration**
```javascript
// Configure webhooks for real-time notifications
const webhookConfig = {
  url: "https://your-endpoint.com/bevor-webhook",
  events: ["vulnerability_found", "analysis_complete"],
  filters: {
    severity: ["critical", "high"],
    types: ["reentrancy", "access_control"]
  }
};
```

**API Access**
```bash
# Export findings via API
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     "https://api.bevor.io/v1/analysis/results/{session_id}"
```

## Best Practices

### Effective Auditing Workflow

1. **Preparation**
   - Set up appropriate analysis profile
   - Configure team collaboration settings
   - Review project documentation and specifications
   - Establish audit scope and objectives

2. **Initial Analysis**
   - Run comprehensive scan across all contracts
   - Review high-severity findings first
   - Identify critical paths and entry points
   - Map out contract interactions and dependencies

3. **Deep Dive Investigation**
   - Focus on complex business logic
   - Analyze economic incentives and game theory
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Verify findings with manual analysis

4. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - Document all findings with clear descriptions
   - Provide specific remediation recommendations
   - Create executive summary for stakeholders
   - Export detailed technical reports

### Performance Optimization

#### Large Project Handling
- Use incremental analysis for large codebases
- Focus on high-risk areas first
- Leverage parallel analysis capabilities
- Configure appropriate timeout settings

#### Memory Management
- Clear analysis cache periodically
- Manage file upload sizes efficiently
- Use streaming analysis for very large files
- Monitor resource usage in browser

## Collaboration Features

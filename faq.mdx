## Troubleshooting

### My analysis is taking too long. How can I speed it up?

**Optimization Strategies:**

- **Incremental Analysis**: Analyze only changed files with `--diff` mode
- **Parallel Processing**: Enable parallel analysis for multiple files
- **Performance Mode**: Use `--fast` mode for quicker, less comprehensive analysis

```bash
# Fast analysis example
bevor scan ./contracts \
  --fast \
  --focus reentrancy,access-control \
  --parallel \
  --timeout 60s
```

### I'm getting false positives. How can I improve accuracy?

**Accuracy Improvement:**
- **Provide Context**: Include more project context and documentation
- **Use Custom Rules**: Configure protocol-specific security rules
- **Label Findings**: Mark false positives to improve future analysis
- **Expert Mode**: Use expert mode for more nuanced analysis

### The API is returning errors. What should I check?

**Common Issues:**
1. **API Key**: Verify key is valid and has sufficient permissions
2. **Rate Limits**: Check if you've exceeded rate limits
3. **Network**: Verify connectivity to api.bevor.io
4. **Request Format**: Ensure request follows API specification

```bash
# Test API connectivity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     "https://api.bevor.io/v1/health"

# Check API key status
bevor auth status --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```
